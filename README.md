# Intelligent Traffic Light Controller with Countdown Timer

## Introduction

Traffic congestion is a critical issue in modern cities worldwide, leading to various problems such as time loss, missed opportunities, and increased frustration. This project addresses traffic congestion by designing an Intelligent Traffic Light Controller using the 8051 microcontroller. The system features a countdown timer to provide drivers with real-time information about the remaining time to the next traffic light state.

## Aim

The primary goal of this project is to create a traffic light controller that optimizes traffic flow, reduces congestion, and enhances overall road safety. The implementation involves the use of 8051 microcontroller, 7-segment displays, LEDs, and a countdown timer to achieve these objectives.

## Implementation

### Components Used

1. **8051 Microcontroller:** Intel's 8-bit microcontroller with 40 pins, featuring on-chip crystal oscillator (12MHz) and 4KB ROM.
2. **7-Segment Displays (Common Anode):** Used to display the countdown timer and provide real-time information to drivers.
3. **LEDs:** Serve as indicators for the traffic lights.
4. **Crystal (12MHz):** Provides the external frequency for the microcontroller.
5. **Other Components:** Push button, capacitors, resistors, traffic lights module.
